### Good Managers Are Not The Solution

One comment that is made when we talk about risk and work flows and business owners making decisions about development and QA teams that don't write tests is the statement, if we had good managers we wouldn't have this problem.

The problem with that statement if you had good managers in a way you wouldn't have the problem, the problem would be solved. That is the wrong positioning because if you had good managers, you wouldn't have that problem because by definition they would be asking the right thing.

So the solution and all these work flows aren't designed for when you have a good manager, a manager that pushes testing, that demands good releases, demands every day releases, demands changes to be done straight away.

That is not what we are talking about or this whole solution is not designed for, this whole solution is designed for in a way and I don't mean like the term but bad managers are not very knowledgeable managers or managers who are just totally focused on the short termness of business decisions without thinking or even taking to account the medium term consequences of their action which is to go back to that idea of pollution is the managers would say just ship it now and we will deal with the pollution later or we will deal with the consequences later. Just get it out to the market, with start-ups you even get sometimes that you know push it out or else we don't have a company.

So, the whole risk work flow, the whole idea of making people accountable is exactly to do with those situations, with the bad managers, the ones that are in a way causing the problem.

And here is how we want to empower developers, empower the technical guys on the ground who are writing code, who basically have a very good grasp of reality or understand the side effects, they are the ones that should be making a good number of technical decisions and have the time to spend on actually coding and understanding what is actually going on.
