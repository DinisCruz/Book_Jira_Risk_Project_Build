### The Pollution Analogy

When talking about risks I much prefer the pollution analogy versus technical debt. The idea is that we are measuring unintended consequences, we are measuring the unintended side effects of creating something. Which is exactly what in a way pollution is.

If we look back in time, pollution has been a side effect of the industrial revolution. And for a long period of time, pollution wasn't seen as a problem the same way that today we still don't see security vulnerability as a problem. We still don't see the fact that views are discovering this massive gaping holes in our infrastructure, in our code and we don't view that as a massive problem.

We don't view the fact that when you find a security vulnerability what you really doing is really questioning hard the whole development pipeline, the whole quality control. How is it possible that these massive gaps, these massive security vulnerabilities, these massive code patterns weren't picked up, weren't understood by the development teams, by the testers, by QA, by the clients, it is just crazy.

So we are in the very infancy of the maturity of software still. So we are still in the 1950s in terms of pollution. So David Rice had a great presentation where he talked about this and basically his concept was exactly this that security is like pollution.

And what we need to do is to make that pollution visible. So I view that the model of the risks is basically a way to measure that pollution, it is a way to measure the difference between team A and team B.

So the good news is then we don't say no from security, we don't say don't do this, don't do that or please give me more time to implement this. We just say well if you want to go for feature A in a particular time line, in a particular scope with a particular brief, then you are going to have this pollution, you are going to have this side effect, you are going to have these unintended consequences or we don't even know. You might have a situation where we say well if you go down this direction we actually don't know the consequences of this change.

So here is a risk for you where basically you are accepting that we do [inaudible 00:02:45] you are accepting that we are basically adding code to our application that we don't understand.

So pollution in that way is much nicer because you can measure, you can quantify, and the analogy is that what we want to do is then start to create a clean code, a code that in a way doesn't pollute which is to do with the evolution of pollution.

The pollution in a way went from a first phase where they pollute to pay also the end of pipe revolution, then there is a second phase where you basically had the greening movement where you start to be a decent brand like when people were polluting less, but the third phase was a more interesting one was when companies were actually starting to produce things differently in ways that didn't completely even pollute. Where almost the products actually have a positive impact on the environment.

So that is really where we want to get to, we want to get to the point where we are creating software that doesn't have pollution. And in fact that makes things better, though we are a long way away from there.
