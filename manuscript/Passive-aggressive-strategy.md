### Passive aggressive strategy

* Keep zooming in on the answers (and refine the Issue scope and focus)
* not finding something is also an Risk
* not having time to research something is also a Risk
* sometimes we just have to open tickets that state the obvious:
  * when are not using SSL (or have an HTTP to HTTPS transition), then we have to open an Risk to be accepted with: _"Our current **SSL** protection **only works when the attacker** we are trying to protect against (via man-in-the-middle) **is not there**"_)
