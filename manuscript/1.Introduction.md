## Introduction

This book will give you a solution for these common problems inside AppSec and Development teams:

  * _"How do I get my manager to take security issues in my app seriously"_
  * _"How do I get time to spend on non-functional requirements and refactoring"_
  * _"We are product-driven development team and don't have time for anything that is not customer-driven"_
  * _"We know our current development, testing and deployment environment is highly inefficient, but how can we prove that to management"_
  * _"We constantly do hacks and compromises before deadlines, but we can't measure its real impact, and how they always tend to be a false economy"_

I find that collectively developers teams know what needs to be done, but they are not usually listened to or empowered to make important decisions about their development priorities and environment. There are always side effects of rushed code and hacks.

This book contains the materials created while using JIRA to manage RISK and measure those side effects

All information presented based on real work experience in creating, implementing and deploying multiple JIRA RISK Projects.

There are 2 main target audiences is AppSec and Developers.

**Why AppSec**

AppSec (Application Security) has massive problem of how to communicate with developers

I created this workflow in order to solve this problem

**Why Developers**

Because developers can use this workflow to control their development workflow, and handle the 'backlog pit of despair' problem.

**Why JIRA**

- It's market penetration (most companies I work for use JIRA)
- JIRA and GitHub are the only Issue tracking system that I have seen that have the kind of  features that are required for the kind of complex workflows that are needed
- comment that this is very different from the JIRA Risk plugins that exist current in the JIRA marketplace

**Why not infoSec**


InfoSec tickets don't tend to work that well with JIRA tickets where InfoSec usually has their tools and dashboards to manage (for example Firewalls, Anti-Virus detections, Active Directory issues)

Could these same techniques be used to manage other types of Risk. Yes but since I don't have that much experience with it, I will leave it to the reader.
