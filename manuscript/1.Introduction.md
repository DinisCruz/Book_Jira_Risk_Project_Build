## Introduction

This book contains the materials created while using JIRA to manage RISK.

This book is based on my real work experience in setting multiple JIRA Projects like this

There are 2 main target audiences is AppSec [^AppSec] and Developers.

**Why AppSec**

AppSec (Application Security) has massive problem of how to communicate with developers

I created this workflow in order to solve this problem

**Why Developers**

Because developers can use this workflow to control their development workflow, and handle the 'backlog pit of despair' problem.

**Why JIRA**

- It's market penetration (most companies I work for use JIRA)
- JIRA and GitHub are the only Issue tracking system that I have seen that have the kind of  features that are required for the kind of complex workflows that are needed
- comment that this is very different from the JIRA Risk plugins that exist current in the JIRA marketplace

**Why not infoSec [^InfoSec]**


InfoSec tickets don't tend to work that well with JIRA tickets where InfoSec usually has their tools and dashboards to manage (for example Firewalls, Anti-Virus detections, Active Directory issues)

Could these same techniques be used to manage other types of Risk. Yes but since I don't have that much experience with it, I will leave it to the reader.
