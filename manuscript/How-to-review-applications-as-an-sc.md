### How to review Applications as an Security Champion

You need to start looking at the application from the point of view of an attacker, because in the beginning thatâ€™s the best way to get your head around it.

You need to start thinking about data inputs, everything that goes into the database, into the application, all the entry points of the application, everything that the attacker could control, and that could be anything from headers to cookies to sockets to anything that actually enters the application.

Authorization is also a great way to take a look. So just looking at how you handle data and how you authorise things is a great way to understand how the application works

* add info about how this is best done using Threat Models and asking the STRIDE questions
