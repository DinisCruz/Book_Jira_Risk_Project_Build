### Security Champions

  - So you want to be an SC?
  - ... here is how you do it...
  - Need to be a developer



### Becoming a Security Champion

To become a security champion, the most important property is that you want to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one day.

Basically you need to be a developer, who understands code (it is really hard to be an AppSec SC and not being able to code).

Your job is to actually start looking at your application and understand the security property of it.

You need to start looking at the application from the point of view of an attacker. In the beginning the best way to get your head around it, is basically to try to think about all the entry points of the application (i.e. inputs).

This is everything that the attacker can control: from GET/POST parameters, to WebServices calls, to headers, to cookies, to websockets, to anything that actually enters the application.

After that, authorization is also a great way to take a look.

Basically, start with doing Threat Models :)

Just looking at how you handle data and how you authorize things, is a great way to actually understand how the application works.


### Security Champions's Books

Hacking Exposed series. The normal version and the Hacking Exposed Web Applications variation are great books.

The Shellcoder’s Handbook is also a great book from an application security point of view, which basically they will walk you through the vulnerabilities.


### OWASP WebGoat

Another great resource is the OWASP WebGoat Project which actually just released a new version, and it basically has a whole bunch of exercises in vulnerabilities so that you can learn how they work (you can get you clues if you are stuck).

The first thing is to actually do those exercises, but also hack in your own applications (it's better if the issues are discovered by you, vs an attacker).

### Hack anything that moves

You should hack anything that moves in your company, because you have a mandate almost to protect your own company (in some companies it might be better to get this 'hack everything' authorization via official channels).

In terms of targets, you can go for your own company, for your own application or  for your colleague’s application (which sometimes it's a bit easier to digest).

### BugBounties

Also go for bug bounties, which is basically a nice list of interface of companies that give you permission to 'hack/attack' them and find security stuff.

### Developers we need YOU in AppSec

 - big oportunity for existing developers to move into appsec

### Big market demand for AppSec Professionals

At the moment there is a massive demand for AppSec devs. Historically the path info InfoSec via Network Security, which means that the majority of InfoSec professionals cannot move to AppSec, because they can't code professionally (i.e. no real knowledge on how to build, test and ship software/apps)

It is also possible to learn on the job since there is such a shortage, which makes it easier to hire Devs who like AppSec and then train them up
