### Weekly meetings

  * explain why these meetings are so important
    * what happens at one of these meetings
    * what is the normal agenda
    * who turns up
  * should happen every week, but a good compromise is for them to occur every other week
  * everything shown and discussed at the Security Champions meeting needs to be done via one or more slides (to be added to that week's slide deck)
  * these slides are VERY important when creating learning materials
  * create wiki pages with a full lisy of all past SC meetings (each entry is categorised by labels)
