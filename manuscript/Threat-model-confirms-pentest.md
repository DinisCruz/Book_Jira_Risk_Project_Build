### Threat Model Confirms Pentest

A key objective of pentest should be to validate the threat model. What they should be doing is confirming whether the expectations and the logic defined in the threat model are actually true and any variation in there is in itself a key finding because it means that there is a gap in the understanding of how the application behaves from the company.

So there are two things, first take the threat models per feature, per layer and confirm that there is no blind spots, confirm that there is no variations on the expectation. Check the code path in a way help improve the understanding of the code path of what is happening in the threat model. And finally more importantly, confirm that there is no extra behaviors.
