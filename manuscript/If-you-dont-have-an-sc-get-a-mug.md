### If you don't have an Security Champion  get a mug

If your dev team doesn't have an assigned security team champion, get one of these Mugs :)

That 'Security Expert' Mug represents the fact that at the moment when a developer has an Application Security question, he might as well ask the dude on that Mug for help :)

I also like that it re-enforces the idea, that for most developer teams, **just having somebody assigned to application security, is already a massive step forward!!**

Basically we have such a skill shortage in our industry for application security developers that **'if you have a heart-beat you qualify'**

#### How to create the SC Mug

  * Get a mug with lots of white space in the front and back
  * write **_Security Champion_** at the front in large letters (but not so big that the text can't be read from a distance)
  * optionally at the back write: **_It's me or Google or Stack Overflow_**
  * optionally if you have a company little stuff animal or object, get one of those and put them inside the Mug

Put the mug in the central and visible place of the team. It is important that the Mug is an isolated place and not really 'assigned' to anybody.

In some teams I've seen the ritual that when a Security Champion is appointed, he/she gets the Mug to put on his desk.
