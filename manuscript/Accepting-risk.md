### Accepting risk

Accepting risk is always a topic of discussion, mostly caused by lack of information. The JIRA Workflows aims at making this process more objective and pragmatic.

Risks can be accepted for a variety of reasons, for example:

  * the system containing the risk will be decommissioned on short term
  * the risk can only occur under very specific circumstances, which would already have caused a bigger risk
  * the cost of fixing (both money as resources) is way higher than the cost of fixing operational issues  
  * the business is ok with the probability of occurrence and it's financial/commercial impact
  * the system is still under development and it is not live
  * the assets managed/exposed by the affected risks are not that important
  * the risk represents a current state of affairs, with significant effort required to change it

Risks should never be accepted for issues that can:

  * threaten the operational existence of the company (e.g. losing a banking license)
  * have significant financial impact (e.g. costs,   fines due to data leaks)
  * have significant business impact (e.g. losing customers)
  * greatly impacting the reputation of a company (e.g. front page news)

The real challenge for companies that have NOT been attacked properly/publicly and don't have an institutional memory of those incidents, is to be able to quantify these risks in real business and financial terms.

Not being attacked is a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because that company has not gone though the pain of those incidents, but a curse because it is easy to gain a false sense of security.

This is why exploits are so important for companies that don't have good internal references (or case studies) or why secure applications matter.

  * add note on how devs should make sure it is they boss who gets fired, and that boos should make sure it is his boss that get fired... all the way to the CTO and CISO
  * accepting risk is done on behalf of his boss (all the way to the CTO)
  * risks are accumulated on the way up
  * part of the higher management role and responsibilities is to accept risk
  * business owners (or who controls the development pipeline) make large number of decisions with very little side effects
  * add explanation of why pollution is a much better analogy than 'Technical Debt' (in measuring the side effects of coding and management decisions).
    * Risk is a nice way to measure this polution
  * _"...you are already being played in this game, so you might as well expose the game and tilt the rules in your favour..."_
