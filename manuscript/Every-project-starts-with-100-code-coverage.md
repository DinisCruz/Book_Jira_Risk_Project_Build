Every app starts with 100% code coverage because by definition, when you start coding, you are covering all of it, in fact you probably had infinite code coverage at that moment in time.

The point is that you want to make sure that you have a very high degree of code coverage right from the beginning. Because if you don't, when you are going to add that code coverage one of those things is that it is easier to let slip and then suddenly you realize you have large junks of your code base not tested.

And what you really want is a situation where every day you get back to that 100% every day. If there is a slip batch or if you suddenly you find that you added code that wasn't fully tested, you bring back and you reverse the coverage back into 100% or as high as it can be for a project. 

Yes and projects of untamed languages have problems to reach certain exceptions, certain things. But even that I always find that every factory can handle those situations.

So it is very important that you get that practice and that discipline of always keeping the app which is where it all makes a big difference, things like Wallably and crunch and some other digitization are actually very, very powerful.

In fact I have seen a team that actually is using kibana to actually track the code coverage which is quite interesting metric.
