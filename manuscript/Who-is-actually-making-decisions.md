### Who is actually making decisions

One of the interesting situations that occurs when we play the risk acceptance game, is to actually find out for real who in the organization is actually making the decisions.

Because originally, what has to happen is the risk test be pushed up, so each person pushed their boss to accept risk. But usually there is a moment where basically what the boss does or aware of the management actually thus he pushes it down. So, you figure out well that isn't my decision, I expect that decision to be made by for example that person.

And usually, you can actually go all the way down then, you can actually go that person and then that person, and usually end up hitting at developer. Which is interesting because as long as the developer is actually making the decisions, he doesn't realise he is making the decisions.

And it is one of those situations where sometimes the developer has a huge amount of power, he just doesn't realise it. So, if you play the risk acceptance game in a way, it is a way to realise who is actually making those decisions. And if anything to empower those because if then the person realises, well if I am the one making the decisions, then he might argue that he wants to be given time, he wants to be given more resources, or even a better decision making power.

So, if he makes a decisions about A, then he also basically makes decisions about B. Which is very, very interesting organisation because usually until you do the exercise of who accepts the risk, those actions are not well defined and who is actually supposed to be accepting or making the decisions is not very well known.
