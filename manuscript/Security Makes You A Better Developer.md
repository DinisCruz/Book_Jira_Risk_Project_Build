**Security Makes You A Better Developer**

When you look at the dev world from a security point of view, you learn very quickly that you need to go deeper than normally a developer would go. You need to understand how things occur, you need to understand how the black magic,how the stuff actually happens under the hood.

And what that gives you, it gives you a spectacular accelerated way of learning something. In a way your brain is not very good at learning when you only see the behavior. It is like when you have instructions, you've been given instructions from a GPS system after a while you don't learn them because your brain doesn't capture it.

So if you are only dealing with behavior, you don't learn very well you don't really know why something is happening or what is in the hood and what is the real root causes of those choices that were made in the app or the framework where it is.

So, security promotes you to go deeper, promotes you to find ways to learn technology, to understand how it works in a way how to test it that is why I have such a strong testing background because I spend so much time trying to replicate things, trying to make things work, trying to connect A to B, try to manipulate data in between A to B.

But what is interesting is that when I go back to development I realize that I have a bigger bag of tricks. I always find that my understanding of technology tends to be much deeper and in a way wider than a lot of developers. 

I might not be the best developer at some algorithms but I do have sometimes a much better toolkit and a much more creative way of solving problems that much more intelligent and better and sometimes creative individuals or developers are not able to do because again their frames of mind are smaller, they don't have a lot of those references.

And referencing is important in programming because a lot of the times once you know that something is possible, you could do it much easily. But when you don't know something is possible, you have this question; well should I go that way that might be you know two hours or ten hours into it and have to give up.
Well if you know something is possible you know that it is X hours away and you can see the evolution or if it is a total lost cause or not.

So those things make a big difference because when you look at the problem it is important to know which rabbit holes you can go and which ways will create good and sound solutions and which ones don't especially when we are talking about testing the app where there tends to be a lot of interesting lateral thinking and creative thinking required and even innovative solutions in order to test specific things.

So ultimately, my argument is that when you do application security, you actually become a better developer, your toolkit expands, your mind opens, and you learn a lot. Just in the last couple of months I had to learn Spark, Go, Camel, Objective C, Spring, Open IM, all these kind of languages and frameworks that I am reviewing and looking at. 

And after a while you get very good at learning new systems, making the connections and that again makes you better because you certainly are much able to observe concepts and technologies.
