### Capture knowledge when devs look at code

- it is key that when a development is looking at code, he has the easy capability to create tickets for 'things noticed'.
- for example methods that need refactoring, complex logic, weird code, hard to visualize architecture, etc...
- if this info/knowledge is not captured, it will be lost
- note that the developer that notices the issue (and opens the ticket) is not able to do something about it (at that moment in time), since he will be focused on solving another bug.
- this can be facilitated by more junior devs (or graduates/work-experience) which can take the responsibility to open and manage these tickets
  - they could even have a go that addressing them (with the developer being the one that merges the PRs)
