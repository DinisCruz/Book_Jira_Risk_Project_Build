### Who is actually making decisions?

One of the interesting situations that occurs when we play the risk acceptance game, is how we find out exactly who in the block organization is making the decisions.

Initially, what has to happen is the risk test is pushed up; each person has pushed their boss to accept risk. But usually there is a moment when the boss resists accepting the risk and pushes it down. The decision to accept risk has to be made by someone else.

In most cases you can follow this line all the way down to the developer. Paradoxically, as long as the developer is making the decisions, he doesn't realize he is making the decisions.

Developers often hold a huge amount of power, but they just don't realize it. Playing the risk acceptance game, and identifying who is deciding on risk, is a way of empowering the decision-maker. If the person can realize their role as a decision-maker, they can argue for more time, more resources, or even a more defined role as a decision-maker.

This exercise is very interesting because usually, until you discover who accepts the risk, the deciding actions are not well-defined, and the person or people who are accepting risk, and making the decisions, are not very well known.
