### Feedback loops are key

An error often made is not spending enough energy and focus in finding the root cause of issues discovered/exploited.

Incidents get identified by operational monitoring or incident response teams, are send to a security department, and after some analysing are directed to development teams as tickets. The development teams have no knowing of the original incident and cannot put the request in the right perspective. This can lead to sub optimal fixes with undesired side-effects.

It is beneficial to include development teams in the root cause analysis from the start to make sure the best solution can be identified.
