### The smaller the ticket scope the better

For bugs and tasks, the smaller the bug the better

Lots of small bugs and issues is great

  - easier to code
  - easier to delegate (between developers)
  - easier to outsource
  - easier to test
  - easier to roll back
  - easier to merge into upstream or legacy branches
  - easier to deploy

It is better to put them is a specially JIRA project(s) which can be focused on Quality (or Non-functional requirements)


  * of course that this needs to be rational and kept into context
  * you should only create a couple of each instance/pattern (specially when they are not being fixed)
    * in this cases you create a 'holding ticket' that will store references to all the individual issues (this is good for systemic vulns)
      * Aggregate issues in Stories
