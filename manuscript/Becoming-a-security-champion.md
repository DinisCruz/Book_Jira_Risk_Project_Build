### Becoming A Security Champion

To become a security champion, the most important property is that you want to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one a full day.

You basically need to be a programmer and understand code, because your job is to actually start looking at your application and understand the security properties of it.

You need to start looking at the application from the point of view of an attacker, because in the beginning that’s the best way to get your head around it.

You need to start thinking about data inputs, everything that goes into the database, into the application, all the entry points of the application, everything that the attacker could control, and that could be anything from headers to cookies to sockets to anything that actually enters the application.

Authorization is also a great way to take a look. So just looking at how you handle data and how you authorise things is a great way to understand how the application works and it's also a great way to do things like threat modeling.

**Books to learn from**

In terms of books, some of the cool books out there, things like Hacking Exposed, both the normal version and the Hacking Exposed: Web Applications, are great books.

The Shellcoder’s Handbook is also a great book from an application security point of view, and they will basically walk you through the vulnerabilities.

Another great resource is the OWASP WebGoat Project which actually just released a new version, and it has a whole bunch of exercises in vulnerabilities so that you can learn how they work and they give you clues for if you get stuck. The first thing is to actually do those exercises and essentially hack into your own applications.

In fact, you can hack anything that moves in your company, because you have a mandate to protect your own company.

In terms of targets, you can go for your own company, go for your own application, or go for your colleague’s application. Sometimes that’s a bit easier to digest.

Also go for things like bug bounties, which are basically companies that give you permission to hack them and find security issues.
