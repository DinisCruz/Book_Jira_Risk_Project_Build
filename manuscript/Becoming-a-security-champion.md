### Becoming A Security Champion

To become a security champion, the most important property is that you want to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one a full day per week to pick up this role. The business should also provide the means to educate and train yourself and other. Increasing and spreading knowledge will increase awareness and control.

You basically need to be a programmer and understand code, because your job is to actually start looking at your application and understand the security properties of it. You should also know 'the tools of the trade' and how to implement them in the most efficient way. Lastly you must be able to identify useful metrics and instruct how to obtain them.
