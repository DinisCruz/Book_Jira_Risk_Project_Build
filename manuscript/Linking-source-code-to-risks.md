### Linking source code to Risks

* add links to risk as source code comments
  * links are added to root cause location and all places it exists
* very powerful technique
* makes the risk visible
* reinforces the concept that there is a cost (i.e. pollution) to write insecure and less-quality code
* positive model where fixes will delete the comments
* allows AppSec team to detect when security reviews are needed (in this case when the comments are removed)
* build tools can scan for these comments and provide a 'risk pollution' indicator


* _add coffee-script example from 'Start with tests' presentation_
