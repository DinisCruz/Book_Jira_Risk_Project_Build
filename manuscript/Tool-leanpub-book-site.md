### Tool leanpub-book-site

- explain what it is and how it works
  - rules of engagement
  - folders and file structure
    - auto-generation of book.txt file
    - consolidation of images

- reason for doing it was :
   1) solve problem of massive image folder (now each chapter is directly mapped to it's images, which is ok as long as the image's name are not repeated)
   2) solve problem of having to maintain the Book.txt file
   3) allow splitting of manuscript folder into separate repo
