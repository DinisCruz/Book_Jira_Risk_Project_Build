### Relationship with existing standards

* Mention how this maps to PCI DSS , HIPAA and other standards
  * most of companies will fail these standards when their existing 'real' RISKs are correctly identified and mapped (which is why there is a big difference between being 'compliant' and being 'secure')

More and more external regulatory bodies and laws require some level of proof about the implemented security controls.

To prevent unnecessary delays or fines, these requirements need to be embedded in the process in the form of regular scans, embedded controls (e.g. in the default infrastructure), or in user stories.

For example in DevOps environments all requirements related to OS hardening should be present in the default container and not be something that development teams need to think about.
