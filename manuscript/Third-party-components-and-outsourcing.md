### Third party components and outsourcing

* these dependencies need to be managed
* lots of control lost to 3rd parties
* open source and close source are very similar
  * at least with open source there is the chance to look at the code (doesn't mean that somebody will)
  * companies need developers that are core contributors of FOSS
* outsource code tends to have lots of 'pollution' and RISKs that are not mapped (until it is too late)
  * liability and accountability of issues is a big problem
  * see OWASP Legal project for an idea of AppSec clauses to include in outsourcing contracts.
