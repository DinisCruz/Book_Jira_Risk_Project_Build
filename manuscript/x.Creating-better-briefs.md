### Creating better briefs

* Developers should use this JIRA workflow to get better briefs and project plans from management (Threat Models are also a key part of this strategy)
* Allow the devs to find the time to do the non-functional requirements that they want to do, but are seldom given it (the time)
* basically this workflow can help developers to solve lots of problems that they have in their own development workflow (and SDL)
