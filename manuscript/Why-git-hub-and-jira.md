**Why Git Hub And Jira**

My current experience is that only git hub and jira have the work flows and the speed that allows these risk work flows to be used properly in the real world. 

I know there are other tools out there that basically try to map this and create some UIs for it, but I found that you need something that is actually very, very close to the way the developers work. It is very connected to the source code which is basically what these tools have.

Jira is more powerful from a point of view of work flows, you can have more complex work flows which is quite interesting in some ways and you do get a nice risk acceptance button which is also very powerful.

Git hub is actually simpler, and in some ways can actually be easy to use and is faster to use although it's reporting capabilities aren't as built as with jira.

But these two tools are the ones I have seen that can really make this work flow work in the real world.
