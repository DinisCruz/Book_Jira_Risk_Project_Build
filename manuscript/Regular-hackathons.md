### Regular Hackathons

* used to find issues and look at new features
* every Friday or Monday afternoon (ideally with some beers and pizza)
  * ideally this would happen every week, if not every 2,3 or 4 weeks
  * what is important is to have movement
* fits well into 10% of research time that developers should have
* inviting external persons (like e.g. pen-testers that regularly test the applications) have the benefit of providing new insights
  * this is also one of the best ways to learn    
    * try to do something and then see a more experienced and knowledgeable person being able to do it
    * see that is the workflow and strategies used by them (to discover and exploit the issue)
* organising red and blue teams (attacker and defenders) can also be very effective
  * these are much are harder to organise, with a lot more preparation needed
