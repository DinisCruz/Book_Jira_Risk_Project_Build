### Two Focus For The Book

This book has two key focus, the first one is how app sec fits within the sec dev ops world. The second one is how a key to make the sec dev ops world work is a risk work flow.

So the first one is all about the actions and the activities that app sec introduces into sec dev ops. Where there is a high focus on testing, a high focus on insurance, a high focus on using the techniques that are part of application security into making the sec dev ops world better.

The second part is a very powerful technique that allows the sec dev ops actions to have meaning in an organization. And what this means, it means you implement a risk work flow based on jira or git hub where every action and every idea that is raised from the sec dev ops world has an implication. And the key is either to be fixed or they are being accepted by the business.

So this book is trying to present ideas, concepts, suggestions for how to actually make this work in the real world and is entirely based on real world experiences, real world experiments, and real world projects across small and large organizations.
