### Mitigating Risk

* One strategy to handle list is to mitigate it
* sometimes external solutions (like a WAF) can be a more effective solution
  * If it fixed the issue and there are Tests that prove it, then it is a valid fix
  * in this case a new RISK needs to be created which says _"Number of security vulnerabilities are currently being mitigated using a WAF, if that WAF is disabled, or there is an WAF bypass exploit, then the vulns will become exploitable"_
