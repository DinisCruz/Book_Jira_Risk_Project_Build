### Using logs to detect risks exploitation

* are your logs and dashboards good enough to tell you what is going on?
* you should be able to know when existing and new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited
* this is a really hard problem that requires serious resources and technology
* specially important for the known risks, can you at least detect them
  * this one of the reasons why a suite of Tests needs to be created that run against live servers
  * not only those Tests will confirm the current status of those issues (across the multiple environment), they will provide the NOC (Network Operations Centre) case studies of that they should be detecting
