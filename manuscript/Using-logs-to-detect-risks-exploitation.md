### Using logs to detect risks exploitation

* are your logs and dashboards good enough to tell you what is going on?
* you should be able to know when existing and new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited
* this is a really hard problem that requires serious resources and technology
* specially important for the known risks, can you at least detect them
  * this one of the reasons why a suite of Tests needs to be created that run against live servers
  * not only those Tests will confirm the current status of those issues (across the multiple environment), they will provide the NOC (Network Operations Centre) case studies of that they should be detecting

#### beware of the security myth

* often no special software or expertise is needed to identify basic potential bad behaviour.
* usually companies already have all the tools and technology needed in house (prob is making them work in the company's reality)
* for example if someone is accessing 20 non-existing pages per second for several minutes, it is most likely someone brute-forcing the application.
  * This can easily be identified by monitoring for 404 and 403 errors per IP address over time.
