### Learning-resources.md


**Books to learn from**

 Hacking Exposed, both the normal version and the Hacking Exposed: Web Applications.

The Shellcoder’s Handbook is also a great book from an application security point of view, and they will basically walk you through the vulnerabilities.

* add more books (with a small description each)

**Vulnerable by design applications**

Another great resource is the OWASP WebGoat Project which actually just released a new version, and it has a whole bunch of exercises in vulnerabilities so that you can learn how they work and they give you clues for if you get stuck. The first thing is to actually do those exercises and essentially hack into these applications.

* Add more examples of apps, split by technology
  * .Net - WebGoat.Net
  * Java - WebBoat
  * Node - NodeGoat, JuiceShop
  * Android - GoatDroid
  * iOS - iGoat
* [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project)


**Hack your apps**

You can hack anything that moves in your company, because you have an implicit mandate to protect your own company.

Go for your own application, or go for your colleague’s application. Sometimes that’s a bit easier to digest :)

**BugBounties**

Also go for things like bug bounties, which are basically companies that give you permission to hack them and find security issues.

* mention programs like https://hackerone.com/
