### Using Git As A Backup Strategy

When you are coding, you are going all sorts of different tangents and Git allows you to actually keep track of all of those tangents and be able to record and save your progress.

In the past we used to code for long periods of time and then eventually we commit everything in the end. Problem with this is that sometimes you go in particular paths that you want to go back or go in particular paths that aren't very efficient or very good. If you commit often and commit early, then you have the ability to keep track of all those changes and it is a much more efficient way of programming.

Of course that before you do the final commit, before you send the push to the main repository you should clean up and make sure the code has certain degree of quality and testing.

But I found that every time I code for a little bit my instinct is already to go and write a commit, keep a track and even if I just add some of it or use the staging capabilities to just do some selective commits, I found that Git gives me a much nicer and cleaner work flow where I have confidence of my changes all the way and I very, very rarely lose any code or any snippet that I was quite happy with.
