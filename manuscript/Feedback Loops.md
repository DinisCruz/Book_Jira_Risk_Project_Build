**Feedback Loops**

Key to dev ops is feedback loops. The most effective and powerful dev ops environment are environments where feedback loops and monitoring and visualizations are not second class citizens. And the more faster you release the more understanding you need to have on what is happening.

So it is key to understand that dev ops it is not silver bullet, in fact anybody selling silver bullets, already selling snake oil. It is a profound transformation on how you build and develop software. 

And it is all about small interactions and basically small development cycles and making sure that you never make big changes at any moment in time. So the feedback loop is very key because what you end up having is situations where you can react very quickly.

The only way you can react quickly is if you have programmatically codified your infrastructure, your deployment, your tests, and what you really want is automation of your understanding, the automation of your tests. And the feedback loops that you get are the ones that really make this possible.

So the success stories of dev ops, all being about the companies who have been moved from waterfall style development very top down to in a way the more agile way of doing things or even teams that were doing agile but it wasn't working very well, to actually being able to ship quickly.

So I like the idea that you push as fast as you can to production, it is key to have the two pipelines as I mentioned in other place of the book where if you are codifying with specific patterns that you know, you go as fast as you can, if you are adding changes that introduce new patterns then you have to have a separate suite of tests instead of suite analysis which is different from the normal paths.

So it is the feedback loops that allows you to understand this, the feedback loops of understanding how you just modify your attack surface, how you just change how your application behaves, how you just change key parts of how everything works and those feedback loops are what allows you to do that.
