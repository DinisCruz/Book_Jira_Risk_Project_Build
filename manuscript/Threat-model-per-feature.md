### Threat Model Per Feature

Creating a threat model for a feature is actually a great way to really understand and to start in a threat model journey. And what you do is you take a very specific path, a very specific new feature that you are adding or property could be something as adding a new field, adding a new functionality.

And then what you want to do is you want to basically create a full flow of just that feature. So you look at the entry point, look at the assets, look at what is actually being used in that feature and then you literally map its inputs, you map the data paths given that the data schemer and then you follow data.

So you see for example how the data go into the application, what it ends up with, who calls who. And what that means it means you have a much more tight brief, a much more tight view of the situation.
