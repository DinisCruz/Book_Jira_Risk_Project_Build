**Risk accepting threat model**

If you are having trouble getting the dev teams to do threat models with you, or for them to spend the time on those threat models, then the solution is to make them accept the risk incurred from having not done a threat model for the application.

The idea is not to be confrontational, but rather to give a very pragmatic and focused statement, which is that this feature doesn't have a threat model.

The idea is that they have to accept that they don't have a threat model. The logic is to create a ticket that says we don't have a threat model and we are going to close it by doing it, or if the developers and their management team don't want to spend the time, you make them accept the risk that you don't have a threat model.

It is very objective and should be very pragmatic, which is quite hard to accept for them, but that's part of the exercise.
