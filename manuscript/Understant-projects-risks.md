### Understand Project's Risks

* know what risk game you (manager and devs) are playing
  * what is the worse case scenario for the application
  * what are you defending (and from whom?)
* what are your incident response plan
* take advantage of the cases when you are not under attack (and you have some time to actually address the issues)
