### Responsible disclosure

Having a responsible disclosure process and/or participating in programs like HackerOne or Bugcrowd have several advantages:

* it shows a level of confidence to the customers
* it provides additional testing cycles
* it sends a message that they have an AppSec program


#### JIRA workflow for bug bounty's submissions

* add diagram (from XYZ)
  * real world example of using an JIRA workflow to manage submissions received
