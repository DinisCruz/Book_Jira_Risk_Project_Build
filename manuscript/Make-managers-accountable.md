### Make managers accountable

* managers need to be accountable for the decisions they make, specially when it has implications for quality and security
* helps to push organisation to accept risk
  * managers will actually 'read' the ticket information for the first time, when ask ed to click on the 'Accept Risk' button
  * this is a 'long game' (played over many months and years)
    * sometimes it takes a management change to the get right dynamic
    * where the new manager is usually not happy when seeing the Risks that are currently accepted and will now be his responsibility
    * the new manager only has a couple months where he can 'blame' this predecessor, after that he really 'owns' that Risk and has Accepted it
* this workflow creates historical records of decisions
