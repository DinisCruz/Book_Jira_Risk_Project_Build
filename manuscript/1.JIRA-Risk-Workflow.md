## JIRA RISK Workflow

![](images/Screen Shot 2016-03-02 at 16.32.58.png)

Key concepts of this workflow

  * All tests should pass all the time
  * Tests that check/confirm vulnerabilities should also pass
  * The key to make this work is to:  
      * Make business owners understand the risks of their decisions (and click on the ‘accept risk' button)

  * it is not about blame ,it is about assigning responsibility and about empowerment

- note that I'm using JIRA for these examples, but these concepts apply to any Bug tracking system
