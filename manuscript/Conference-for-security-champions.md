### Conference for Security Champions

Every 6 to 12 months, it is good to have a conference exclusively dedicated to Security Champions (specially for companies that multiple locations and where the Security Champions don't meet regularly in person)


  * Bring external speakers to present on specific topics
    * if there are already a number of external AppSec consulting companies under contract, the consultants involved in existing projects are perfect candidates to present
      * they can use their own examples and stories
      * make it easier to present internal materials if all participants are under NDA
  * never underestimate the power of team collaboration and on getting team members to know each other
  * social events are quite important
  * the model of OWASP Summit's is also a good one
  * Microsoft Blue Hat is a good example of what this could look like (find other examples)
